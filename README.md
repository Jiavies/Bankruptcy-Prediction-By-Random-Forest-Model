# Bankruptcy-Prediction-By-Random-Forest-Model
**Predict the bankrupt status by classification models including Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest.**
**This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a company is likely to go bankrupt in the following year, based on its financial attributes. The scenario simulates a real-world use case, such as a lender or investor assessing a firm’s short-term financial stability.**
## Objectives
- ### Build a classification model to detect potential bankruptcy risks

- ### Follow the complete machine learning pipeline: data exploration → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation

- ### Demonstrate the ability to independently structure and deliver a data science solution, similar to a pre-interview coding task
## Notebook Structure
- ### Problem Statement & Goals

- ### Data Loading & Preprocessing

- ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- ### Model Selection & Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

- ### Evaluation Metrics Comparison (Accuracy, Recall, F1 Score)

- ### Result Visualization & Interpretatio
